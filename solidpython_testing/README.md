This is a testing branch for SolidPython as an alternative to OpenSCAD.

SolidPython is a wrapper over OpenSCAD which generates standalone OpenSCAD code using Python.
The hopes is to create an easier to use, more adjustable, and more robust framework to develop the Roller Screw.
Other OpenSCAD files can be used so existing libraries can still be utilized.

Intended Advantages:
	- More Robust framework
	- Flexibility in usage
	- Clearer usage
	- Quick adjustments of design
	- Off-load some of the more complex calculations to python
	- Thread standard swaps
	- Overall easier development and end-usage
