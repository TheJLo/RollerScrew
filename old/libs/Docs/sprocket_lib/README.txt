# Summary

This is a sprocket generator that is designed and coded to be easy to use, even if you are new to OpenSCAD. Customize your own sprocket according to your needs and export it directly to a .stl file. Slice it and print it!

For example, you can change:
- Bore diameter
- Teeth count
- Pitch, roller diameter
- Tolerance
- Thickness
- Shaft length and diameter
- Number of holes evenly distributed
- and a lot more...

Test it using the Customizer to the right --> !

Use PETG or Nylon for best results with 100% infill, many wall layers and concentric filling setting.

The code is generously commented and easy to understand for you to make your own adjustments if required by your specific application. All measurements is in millimeters.

Enjoy!
